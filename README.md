# Pop-on-Arch
Repository to make a Pop!_OS clone on arch with the KDE desktop environment


## Installation

1. Place ./aurorae/Pop in ~/.local/share/aurorae/themes (create the directory if it doesn't exist)

1. The colorscheme goes in `~/.kde/share/apps/color-schemes`

1. Finally, activate both themes by setting the colors and window decorations from your system settings.

## Recommendations for a unified look:
  * Fira Sans Book size 10 font for General, Small, Toolbar, and Menu
  * Fira Sans Bold size 10 for Window Title
  * FiraCode or FuraCode Nerd Font for Fixed width
  * Install Pop Icons set from the [Pop!_OS](https://github.com/pop-os/icon-theme) github
  * Install the Pop GTK theme from the [Pop!_OS](https://github.com/pop-os/gtk-theme) github and set it for GTK apps
  * If using Latte Dock, remove panel shadow and set panel background to opaque
  * Use the [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-contrib) colorscheme for Konsole and text editors

Feel free to submit bugs if anything looks out of place.
