pop-gtk-theme (4.0.0) bionic; urgency=medium

    This version includes an all-new version of the Pop!_GTK theme. After a lot
    of hard work, the theme SCSS has been completely re-written from the ground-
    up with all new implementations and styling for widgets. This has combined
    to make Pop!_GTK one of the smallest complete GTK Stylesheets the authors
    can find, which will keep the loading times and RAM usage low. It has also
    reduced the number of required assets to just four files, which minimizes
    installation time and package size, and greatly eases maintainence.

    The new version also includes a completely re-worked build system which
    also greatly eases maintainence of the theme for developers. This includes
    usage of native MAKE build formats that make the installation faster and
    more reliable.
